## Introduction

# Mission
We are dedicated to revolutionizing glass recycling with a singular focus on environmental sustainability, community engagement, and technological innovation. Our purpose is to create a transformative ecosystem that transcends traditional recycling practices, establishing a dynamic and interconnected network for glass waste management.

# Why is glass waste a problem?
We consider glass waste an incredible problem because it is not biodegradable. Disposing of it into landfills is not environmentally responsible and glass tends to interfere with other recyclables like paper and cardboard and this results in glass lowering its value.

# Proposed Solution?
Our project seeks to minimize the environmental footprint associated with glass disposal. Through cutting-edge technology and community involvement, we aim to streamline the glass recycling process. The Pi Eco Crystal Project strives to inspire individuals and communities to actively participate in glass recycling.

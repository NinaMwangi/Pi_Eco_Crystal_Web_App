We consider glass waste an incredible peoblem beacaue it is not biodegradable. Disposing it into landfills is not environmentally responsible and glass tends to interfere with other recyclables like papar and cadboard and this results in glass lowering their value.

The Pi Eco Crystal Project strives to inspire individuals and communities to actively participate in glass recycling
